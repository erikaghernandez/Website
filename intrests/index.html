      <h2> Podcasts </h2>
      <p>
          One thing that I never thought I would really enjoy was podcasts. But to my surprise it
          turns out they are not that bad. Lately, I have been listening to The Last Podcast on
          the Left, which is under the categories of dark comedy and true crime. I also occasionally
          listen to Impaulsive which lies under the entertainment category. I have been wanting
          to expand my podcast library and see what else I like.

      <h3>Stuff You Should Know: Short Stuff</h3>
      <p>
        In my quest to find more podcasts to listen to I ran across this particular podcast. At
        first I started to listen to the regular 45-50 minute podcast but I found myself getting
        too distracted. Then I noticed that there were also shorter podcasts under the same
        creators. They are referred to as "Short Stuff". They are shorter, just 15 minutes! Which I
        find quite nice because I can listen to one episode as background without necessarily
        focusing all my attention.

      <h3>Yeah No, I'm Not Okay</h3>
        <h4>"Growing up, I was taught to say that I was "ok" when I really wasn't."</h4>
          <p>
            This podcast was created by one of my favorite actors, Diane Guerrero. She is an actor
            with Latino heritage which is important because in this podcast she focuses on
            addressing mental health. But by no means does this podcast give clinical advice but it
            is rather an open conversation on the topic. I have just listened to one episode and so
            far I like it so I will definitely listen to a second episode.
