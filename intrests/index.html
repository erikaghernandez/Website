    <h2> Podcasts </h2>
    <p>
        One thing that I never thought I would really enjoy was podcasts. But to my surprise it
        turns out they are not that bad. Lately, I have been listening to The Last Podcast on
        the Left, which is under the categories of dark comedy and true crime. I also occasionally
        listen to Impaulsive which lies under the entertainment category. I have been wanting
        to expand my podcast library and see what else I like.

    <h3>Stuff You Should Know: Short Stuff</h3>
    <p>
      In my quest to find more podcasts to listen to I ran across this particular podcast. At
      first I started to listen to the regular 45-50 minute podcast but I found myself getting
      too distracted. Then I noticed that there were also shorter podcasts under the same
      creators. They are referred to as "Short Stuff". They are shorter, just 15 minutes! Which I
      find quite nice because I can listen to one episode as background without necessarily
      focusing all my attention.

    <p>My top 3 Short Stuff episodes:</p>
