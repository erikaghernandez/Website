    <h2> Podcasts </h2>
      <p>
        One thing that I never thought I would really enjoy was podcasts. But to my surprise turns
        out they are not that bad. Lately, I have been listening to The Last Podcast on the Left,
        which is under the categories of dark comedy and true crime. I also occasionally listen to
        Impaulsive which lies under the entertainment category. Yet, I have been wanting to expand
        my podcast library and see what this medium really has to offer.

      <p><strong> THIS PAGE IS NOT COMPLETE! I will probably change it</strong></p>

      <p>
        Possible idea: Maybe make a blog out of this where I can try at least 3 podcasts other than
        the ones I currently listen to(each a different genre) and post my thoughts on them.(change
        name if this becomes the final)
